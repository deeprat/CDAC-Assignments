Create the following classes
Employee
   Prop	
	string Name -> no blanks
	int EmpNo -> readonly, autogenerated
	short DeptNo -> > 0
	abstract decimal Basic 
   Methods
	abstract decimal CalcNetSalary()


Manager : Employee
   Prop
	string Designation -> cant be blank
	

GeneralManager : Manager
   Prop
 	string Perks -> no validations

CEO : Employee
      Make CalNetSalary() a sealed method

NOTE : Overloaded constructors in all classes calling their base class constructor 
All classes must implement IDbFunctions interface
All classes to override the abstract members defined in the base class(Employee). Basic property to have different validation in different classes.
